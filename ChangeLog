0.7.4  18/02/02		Fix condition too strong in docsis_decode.c.
evvolve			

0.7.3  16/02/02		Change symbols so that {symbol_name,docsis_code} is 
evvolve			"primary key" (the above pairs are unique in the
			entire symbol table).
			Fix errors with IpTos encoding (still buggy)
			We took over full maintainership from Cornel.

0.7.2  12/02/02		Fix typos in docsis_symtable.h
evvolve			

0.7.1  08/02/02		Split encoding functions into docsis_encode.{h,c}	
evvolve			Implemented Hex String and Ether+Ethermask encoders.
			Implemented range checking for string and hex string
			encoders.
			We added many DOCSIS 1.1 configuration settings to 
 			docsis_symtable.h. Got bored, so if you want more please
			add them yourself and send us a patch.
			Updated CMTS MIC calculation to use the new 1.1 config
			settings in addition to the 1.0 ones (as per the 
			latest DOCSIS RFI). 

0.7.0  06/02/02		New "decoding" framework similar to the encoding 
evvolve			framework makes adding new "symbols" as easy as 
 			editing the "docsis_symtable.h" file. 
			As an example, support for the DOCSIS 1.1 Downstream
			Packet Classifiers was added. 
			Bugs were found and some were even fixed in the 
			process. 
			Started adding 1.1 stuff to the project.
