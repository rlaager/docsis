        Sequence of:
          4 bytes: ChCenterFreq
                   The center frequency of the upstream channel.
          4 bytes: FreqSpan
                   The width in Hz of the band across which the spectral
                   amplitudes characterizing the channel are measured.
          4 bytes: NumberOfBins
                   The number of data points or bins that compose the
                   spectral data. The leftmost bin corresponds to the
                   lower band edge, the rightmost bin corresponds to the
                   upper band edge, and the middle bin center is aligned
                   with the center frequency of the analysis span.
          4 bytes: BinSpacing
                   The frequency separation between adjacent bin
                   centers. It is derived from the frequency span and
                   the number of bins or data points.
                   The bin spacing is computed as:

                            BinSpacing = FrequencySpan/(NumberOfBins -1)

                   The larger the number of bins the finer the
                   resolution.
          4 bytes: ResolutionBW
                   The resolution bandwidth or equivalent noise
                   bandwidth of each bin. If spectral windowing is used
                   (based on vendor implementation), the bin spacing and
                   resolution bandwidth would not generally be the same.
          n bytes: Amplitude (2 bytes * NumberOfBins)
                   A sequence of two byte elements. Each element
                   represents the spectral amplitudes in relation to the
                   expected received signal power of a bin, in units of
                   0.01dB. That is, a test CMTS input signal with
                   square-root raised-cosine spectrum, bandwidth equal
                   to the expected received signal bandwidth, and power
                   equal to the expected received signal power, which
                   is present for the entire spectrum sampling period,
                   will exhibit a spectrum measurement of 0 dB average
                   power in each bin of the signal passband.
                   Each bin element amplitude value format is 2's
                   complement which provides a range of -327.68 dB to
                   327.67 dB amplitude value for the bin measurement."

        symbols) / (average squared magnitude of error vector)

        RxMER is measured just prior to FEC (trellis/Reed-Solomon)

        HFC channel as well as implementation effects of the
        modulator and demodulator. Error vector estimation
        may vary among demodulator implementations.  The CMTS
        RxMER is averaged over a given number of bursts at
        the burst receiver, which may correspond to transmissions
        from multiple users. In the case of S-CDMA mode,
        RxMER is measured on the de-spread signal."
