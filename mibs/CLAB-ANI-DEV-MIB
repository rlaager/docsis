	MAX-ACCESS	read-write
	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"Setting this object to resetLog(1) empties the logging
		table. Setting this object to pauseLog(2) causes the
		ANI device to stop writing events to the logging table. Setting
		this object to startLog(3) causes the ANI device to start writing
		events to the logging table. Reading this object returns
		either pauseLog(2) or startLog(3). The default is
		startLog(3). Log event pausing is independent of any other
		log filtering mechanisms, e.g., levels. Setting it to
		useDefaultReporting(4) resets the log (i.e., empties) and
		returns all event levels to the factory-default reporting."

 	DESCRIPTION
 	 	"The current logging priority level for system messages.
 		 Setting a level sets all levels from the level specified
 		 to the highest severity level except for “off”. The level
 		 “all” indicates all levels. The log levels are derived from
 		 the log4j class.

 		 all(1) The all level has the lowest possible rank and is intended
 		 to turn on all logging.

 		 trace(2) The trace level designates finer-grained informational
 		 events than the DEBUG (see log4j class for further definition).

 		 debug(3) The debug level designates fine-grained informational
 		 events that are most useful to debug an application.

 		 info(4) The info level designates informational messages that
 		 highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.

 		 warn(5) The warn level designates potentially harmful situations.

 		 error(6) The error level designates error events that might still
 		 allow the application to continue running.

 		 fatal(7) The fatal level designates very severe error events
 		 that will presumably lead the application to abort.

 		 off(8) The off has the highest possible rank and is intended to
 		 turn off logging."

 -- The ANI Device System Logging table.
--
-- This table is used as an event logging table shared by the system
-- and applications. Note that network-related events are still
-- recorded in the aniDevSysLoggingEventTable. The ANI device adds an
-- event by adding a conceptual row to the end of the table.
-- Once the table 'fills' by reaching aniDevSysLoggingSize, adding a
-- new event causes the oldest conceptual row to be removed.
